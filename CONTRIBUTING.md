# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MagmaWM! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and enhance the project. Please take a moment to review the guidelines below before making any contributions.

## Getting Started

To contribute to MagmaWM, you will need to have a basic understanding of the Rust programming language, Smithay Library and the Wayland protocol. Familiarity with Git and GitHub is also recommended.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. Fork the MagmaWM repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Set up the project dependencies as mentioned in the "Build" section of the README.
4. Make your desired changes or additions to the codebase.
5. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as intended.
6. Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
7. Push your changes to your forked repository.
8. Open a pull request on the main MagmaWM repository.

## Contribution Guidelines

To ensure a smooth and collaborative contribution process, please follow these guidelines:

### 1. Branching

Create a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or enhancement you are working on. This helps to keep the changes organized and makes it easier to review and merge them later.

Use meaningful and descriptive names for your branches that reflect the purpose of the changes.

### 2. Code Style

Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project. Consistent code style makes it easier for others to understand and maintain the codebase.

MagmaWM is primarily written in Rust, so adhere to the official Rust style guidelines outlined in the Rust Style Guide. You can use the `rustfmt` tool to automatically format your code according to these guidelines.

### 3. Testing

Whenever possible, run tests for your changes to ensure they work as expected and to prevent regressions.

### 4. Documentation

Document your code changes, especially if they introduce new functionality or modify existing behavior. This includes adding comments, updating README files, and providing examples or usage instructions when necessary.

Keep the documentation up to date with your changes to ensure accuracy and clarity.

### 5. Commit Messages

Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of each commit. Each commit should represent a logical unit of work.

Use present tense and imperative mood in your commit messages (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

### 6. Pull Requests

Open a pull request (PR) on the main MagmaWM repository when you are ready to submit your changes for review.

Include a detailed description of the changes made, along with any relevant information that could help reviewers understand your work.

Be responsive to feedback and actively participate in the discussion during the review process. Address any requested changes or comments in a timely manner.

### 7. Licensing

By contributing to MagmaWM, you agree to license your contributions under the project's GPLv3 license. Make sure you have the necessary rights to the code you are contributing.
